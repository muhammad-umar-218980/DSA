                     TREE (Data Structure)
    -----------------------------------------------
    A Tree is a non-linear hierarchical data structure 
    consisting of nodes connected by edges.

    - The topmost node is called the Root.
    - Each node can have child nodes.
    - Nodes with no children are called Leaf Nodes.
    - The connection between nodes is called an Edge.
    - Trees do not contain any cycles.

    Trees are widely used to represent hierarchical relationships,
    such as:
        - File systems (folders and files)
        - HTML document structure (DOM)
        - Organization charts
        - Binary Search Trees (for searching and sorting)

                  GENERIC TREE
    -----------------------------------------------
    A Generic Tree (also called a General Tree) 
    is a tree where each node can have any number of children.

    Example:
             A
           / | \
          B  C  D
             / \
            E   F

    - Here, node A has 3 children (B, C, D).
    - Node C has 2 children (E, F).
    - There is no restriction on how many children a node can have.

                 BINARY TREE
    -----------------------------------------------
    A Binary Tree is a special type of tree where 
    each node can have at most two children.

    Example:
             A
            / \
           B   C
          / \
         D   E

    - Here, every node has 0, 1, or 2 children.
    - These children are referred to as the Left Child 
      and the Right Child.
